# final-Iteration2
## Week 1
For the first week  i mainly spent adding feature from iteration 1 
parts from [Iteration1](https://github.com/JAX3/Runner-game-Iteration1) Which includes 
- varying height of platforms
- scoring system
- obstacles (fire)
and adjusting the platform speed due to it being a bit difficult  since the plays jump would land just before the platform.
During the week i also spent trying to fix the timer system as the previous one was hacked together and was a bit clunky in the way it operated 
```javascript
 timedEvent = this.time.addEvent({ delay: 10000, callback: counter, repeat: 10, startAt: 8000 });
 ```
